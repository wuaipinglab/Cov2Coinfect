***

### Overview
The overview.

### Usage
1.Run `get_lineagesFV_and_mutationNum.py` to get lineages feature variations and number of global SARS-CoV-2 nonsynonymous mutations.
2.Run `get_candidate_lineages.py` to get candidate with-in host lineages.
3.Run `identify_co-infection_lineages.py` to get defined with-in host lineages, and distinguish co-infection from quasispecies in one virus.
